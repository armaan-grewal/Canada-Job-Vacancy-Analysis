# Canada-Job-Vacancy-Analysis
This Python program allows users to compare job vacancies across two Canadian provinces based on the required education level. It reads data from a CSV file (educationLevel.csv) containing job vacancy statistics and generates a side-by-side bar chart visualizing the comparison.
